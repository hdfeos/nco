This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the netCDF Operators
(NCO).

This package was originally assembled by Brian Mays <brian@debian.org>
from software obtained from ftp://ftp.cgd.ucar.edu/pub/zender/nco

NCO package modifications for Debian GNU/Linux made from 1999--2002
are Copyright (C) Brian Mays and were released under the GPL 
(on Debian systems see "/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL").

Beginning March, 2003, Charlie Zender and Rorik Peterson took over 
NCO Debian package maintenance and merged the code back upstream.
More information at package homepage http://nco.sourceforge.net

On June 15, 2003, Charlie Zender changed the NCO license, except where  
explicitly noted otherwise, from GPL to GPL version 2 (not any later version).
Also at this time the explicit exceptions to the GPL for compatibility with
the HDF, netCDF, OPeNDAP, and UDUnits licenses were formally introduced.

On July 22, 2007, Charlie Zender changed the NCO licenses, except where 
explicitly noted otherwise, from GPL2 to GPL3 (for code) and from 
FDL 1.1 (or any later version) to FDL 1.2 (or any later version) for 
documentation. 

On January 20, 2009, Charlie Zender changed the NCO license for documentation,  
except where explicitly noted otherwise, from FDL 1.2 (or any later version) 
to FDL 1.3 (or any later version).

On July 15, 2009, Charlie Zender added Benjamin Sittler and John Burkhardt
to this copyright file to reflect their copyrights. Both retain copyright
to their work which is licensed BSD-style (freely redistributable so long 
as copyright notices are maintained). 

On July 15, 2009, Charlie Zender received copyright assignments from 
Henry Butowsky and Karen Schuchardt. Their names were removed from the
copyright statements in the files where they had been listed:
nco_msa.c, nco_msa.h, and nco_aux.c.

On January 26, 2010, Charlie Zender removed John Burkhardt from this 
copyright file after removing his gamma function code (nco_gmm.c)
from the source. 

On May 17, 2019, Charlie Zender changed the license of the computational
geometry routines (then in nco_crt.[ch], nco_sph.[ch]) to BSD with the
permission of the original author, Joseph O'Rourke.

On February 14, 2020, Charlie Zender changed all licenses of NCO source
code from GPL3 to BSD 3-clause.
